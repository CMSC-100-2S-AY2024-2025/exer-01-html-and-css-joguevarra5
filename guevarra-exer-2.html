                <p class="text"> Passenger Rush was a joint project between Joy Guevarra and her friend and classmate, Luthelle
                    Fernandez. It features self-made assets made by Joy Guevarra and soundtracks pulled from online sources.
                    The goal of the game is to go around the map and pick up as many passengers possible at their designated stations
                    all the while collecting power-ups and avoiding calamities. The player with the most passengers unloaded at the
                    Unloading Zone wins. </p>

                <p class="text"> Silly Pedestrian was one of the final exercise requirements of CMSC 22. Its
                    objectives were to train the developers in using JavaFX. The assets were purely made by
                    Joy Guevarra. It features two pedestrians walking across the map whilst two cars race
                    across the screen. Each car has three lives, and each time they collide with a pedestrian,
                    their health goes down. The car with the most number of lives by the end of the game wins. </p>

                <p class="text"> Diet Planner was a project made for the course CMSC 150. Its code is entirely 
                made with R and R Shiny, with R handling the logic process and R Shiny giving it a GUI. It is designed 
                to calculate the best combination of foods selected by the user that will guarantee them the optimal amount 
                of nutrients with the least cost possible. </p>

                <p class="text"> The Ticketing Website was made in compliance with the requirements of CMSC 12, a subject
                taken by freshmen. It is designed to showcase a selection of movies which the user can choose from and specify
                the date and quantity of the tickets to be bought. It also gives the users the option to avail snacks. After which,
                a receipt is given to the user detailing their expenses. </p>

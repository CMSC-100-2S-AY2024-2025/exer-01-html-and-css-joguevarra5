○ What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
My key takeaway is that creating a website takes a lot of time and effort. I had a lot of issues with finalizing the design, the direction I wanted to go with, etc. It requires an insane attention to detail because you have to keep track of which elements will make use of which classes and/or id's, and what modification in CSS will you apply to them.
